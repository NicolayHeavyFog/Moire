# moire

Moire was created for educational purposes. I used Vue 3 composition API, typescript, Vuex, and Vue-router.

The global store was broken into modules.

I used the Zod validation library along with TS.

After all, I obtained so cool results expressed in a full-fledged application that is implemented completely starting with filling the basket with things and ending with writing out the order number to you. An access token exists too, for real.
